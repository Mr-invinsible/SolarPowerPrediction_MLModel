# Weak_1
In the first week of this AICTE Internship project, our focus was on understanding and preprocessing the data to set the foundation for predicting solar power output using linear regression. The dataset contains environmental factors such as sunlight intensity, temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud cover, which impact solar energy generation.
# Week_2
In the second week of this AICTE Internship project, our project was to further understant how to manipulate data and advance preprocessing of the data for the use in the solar power prediction machine learning model based on linear regression.
